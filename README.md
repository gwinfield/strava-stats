# 2023 Strava Statistics: Democratizing Fitness Insights

## The Problem:
Strava, a popular workout tracking app, only offers year-end insights to their Premium members. As someone who refuses to purchase a paid membership, I decided that there has to be a way to gain valuable insights about my fitness trends from 2023. Like many apps, Strava allows users to request their data, so I started there and ran with a few ideas.

## My Solution:
I first wanted to gain insights on my own data, so I cleaned and explored my own data primarily using Pandas. The data proved to be most interesting divided two ways: by month and by activity. 

From here, I tucked my introductory analysis away and started thinking about creating an interface. This is my first true endeavor into coding, and I am new to building products. My limited expertise is in Python, so I explored ways to build only with Python rather than using a full stack.

My exploration brought me to Streamlit: an open-source app framework and Python library. Their extensive documentation guides coupled with the "Coding is Fun" channel on YouTube helped me bring my ideas to life.
